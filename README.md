### App deployed [here](relaxed-kepler-537814.netlify.app)

### User Stories
**Core**
* As a user, I want to see SpaceX's inventory before I sign up so that I get a good idea of their capability. 
  - Acceptance criteria: a list of suppliers is displayed with key information shown
  - Page loads in a sensible amount of time   

**Extras** 
* As a user, so that I can get an overview of their projects, I would like to filter their inventory by categories.
* As a user, so that I am not overloaded with information, I would like to see 8 items on display, at a time. 
* As a user, so that I can better navigate their inventory, I would like to see everything sorted alphabetically.
